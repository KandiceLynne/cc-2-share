This is my catch all dump repo that has a multiude of random hacks/scripts that you are welcome to use. 

WinToolsSetup - Is a nifty PowerShell Script that installs the basics for DevOps tools on Windows:
    Chocolately
      choco install git -y
      choco install docker-desktop -y
      choco install kubernetes-cli -y
      choco install terraform -y
      choco install azure-cli -y
      choco install awscli -y
