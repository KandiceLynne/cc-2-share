## Cool code to share to the public

This is my catch all dump repo that has a multiude of random hacks/scripts that you are welcome to use. I know there is not a lot here. I hope to move more of my code over in the coming months to share for all to use.

## GHA folder is a dump for GitHub Actions yaml files for workflows

## My random Python scripts to share are in the Python Directory (pretty self explainatory)

## PowerShell directory are random PowerShell Scripts to share

WinToolsSetup - Is a nifty PowerShell Script that installs the basics for DevOps tools on Windows:
    Chocolately
      choco install git -y
      choco install docker-desktop -y
      choco install kubernetes-cli -y
      choco install terraform -y
      choco install azure-cli -y
      choco install awscli -y
      choco install visualstudiocode -y
